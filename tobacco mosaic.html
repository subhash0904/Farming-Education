    <h1>Disease Symptoms of Tobacco Mosaic Disease</h1>

    <h2>Tobacco Mosaic Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Affected plants show leaves with a mottling or mosaic pattern of light green and dark-green areas.</p>
    <p>Primary symptoms appear on newly formed young leaves as vein clearing, greenish yellow mottling.</p>
    <p>Infection on young plants results in stunted growth, malformation, distortion, and puckering of leaves. Dark-green blisters and sometimes enations (leafy growth) appear on the dorsal side of the leaf.</p>

    <h2>Transmission and Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>TMV is highly contagious and transmitted by sap. It is easily transmitted by mere contact of a diseased plant with a healthy one.</li>
        <li>Air-dried tobacco is a common source of new infection. Workers who chew or smoke natural leaf tobacco during nursery operations may spread the virus into the seedlings.</li>
        <li>Old stems and leaf trash of affected plants buried in the soil are the other sources of infection and spread.</li>
        <li>In the nurseries, seedlings may get affected due to the presence of susceptible weed hosts.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Tobacco Mosaic Disease. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
