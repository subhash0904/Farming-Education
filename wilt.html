        <h1>Sugarcane Fusarium Wilt Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first symptoms of the disease become apparent only when the plant has grown for about 4-5 months.</li>
            <li>Gradual yellowing and drying of foliage, shrinkage/withering of canes.</li>
            <li>If the affected canes are cut and examined, the pith will be light to dark purplish or brown discoloration of ground tissue, pithiness, and boat-shaped cavities in the middle of the internodes.</li>
            <li>A characteristic disagreeable odor is also associated with this disease.</li>
            <li>Often a cottony white mycelium is seen in the pith region.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identification of Pathogen:</h2>
        <p>The fungal mycelium is hyaline, septate, and thin-walled. The conidiophores are simple or branched and produce single-celled, hyaline, oval to elliptical microconidia. Macroconidia are straight with 3-5 septae measuring 27-73 × 3.4-5.2 mm. Blastoconidia are either straight, sickle-shaped, or pike-shaped with 2-3 septae. Moreover, they will be found as elliptical cell-shaped structures with 1.43 × 3.0-4.5 mm in size.</p>

        <h2>Management Strategies:</h2>

        <div class="method">
            <h3>Cultural Method:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Selection of healthy seed setts from a disease-free area for planting.</li>
                <li>Grow resistant varieties like Co 617 and B.P.17, which are more resistant than other varieties.</li>
                <li>Crop rotation, managing root borer, avoiding prolonged drought and waterlogging, and hygienic practices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="method">
            <h3>Chemical Method:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dip the setts in 40 ppm of boron or manganese, or spray the plants with either of these minor elements to reduce the disease intensity.</li>
                <li>Sett treatment with fungicide like Bavistin, 0.1 per cent before planting.</li>
                <li>Apply carbendazim @ 2gm/lit of water at the root zone area and the same as a follow-up at 15 days interval.</li>
            </ul>
