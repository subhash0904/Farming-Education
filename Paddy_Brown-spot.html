        <h1>Brown Spot Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brown Spot is also known as sesame leaf spot, Helminthosporiose, or fungal blight.</li>
            <li>The fungus attacks the crop from seedling in the nursery to the milk stage in the main field.</li>
            <li>The disease appears as minute brown dots, later becoming cylindrical or oval to circular (resembling sesame seeds).</li>
            <li>Spots measure 0.5 to 2.0mm in breadth, coalescing to form large patches.</li>
            <li>Several spots coalesce, and the leaf dries up.</li>
            <li>Infection also occurs on the panicle, neck with brown color appearance.</li>
            <li>Seeds are also infected (black or brown spots on glumes covered by olivaceous velvety growth).</li>
            <li>The seedlings die, and affected nurseries can be often recognized from a distance by their brownish scorched appearance.</li>
            <li>Dark brown or black spots also appear on glumes.</li>
            <li>The infection of the seed causes failure of seed germination, seedling mortality, and reduces grain quality and weight.</li>
            <li>Severe cases can lead to a 50% yield reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mode of Spread and Survival</h2>
        <p>
            The infected seeds are the most common source of primary infection. The fungus also survives on collateral hosts.
            It can survive in the seed for more than 4 years. Infected seeds, volunteer rice, infected rice debris, and several weeds
            are the major sources of inoculums in the field. The disease is common in nutrient-deficient soils and unflooded soil
            but rare on rice grown on fertile soils. Abnormal soils, which are deficient in nutrient elements, or soils in a much-reduced
            condition in which toxic substances accumulate favor the development of the disease.
        </p>

        <h2>Identification of Pathogen</h2>
        <p>
            Brown Spot: Helminthosporium oryzae—FUNGAL DISEASE (Syn: Drechslera oryzae) (Sexual stage: Cochliobolus miyabeanus)
        </p>
        <p>
            The fungi causing the disease occur in two states or stages. These are the asexual stage, which is called anamorph or imperfect stage,
            and the sexual stage, which is called teleomorph or the perfect stage. The somatic structures of the fungus consist of black velvety mycelial mats
            made up of prostrate hyphae and erect sporophores. The hyphae are abundant, branching, and anastomosing. They are dark brown or olivaceous and
            measure 8-15 µm or more in diameter. The sporophores arise as lateral branches from the hyphae. The conidia measure 35-170 x 11-17 µm.
            Typical conidia are slightly curved, widest at the middle and tapering toward the hemispherical apex, where their width approximates half the median width.
            Mature conidia are brownish with a moderately thin peripheral wall.
        </p>

        <h2>Favourable Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature of 25-30°C.</li>
            <li>Relative humidity above 80 per cent.</li>
            <li>Excess of nitrogen aggravates the disease incidence.</li>
            <li>Leaves must be wet for 8-24 hours for infection to occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management Strategies</h2>
        <h3>Cultural Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As the disease is seed-borne, use disease-free seeds.</li>
            <li>Removal of alternate & collateral hosts.</li>
            <li>Use of resistant varieties is the most economical means of control.</li>
            <li>Growing resistant varieties like ADT 44, PY 4, CORH 1, CO 44, CAUVERY, BHAVANI, TPS 4, and Dhanu.</li>
            <li>Provide proper nutrition for optimum plant growth and prevent water stress.</li>
            <li>The disease is rarely observed in normally fertile rice soils. Soils known to be low in plant-available silicon should be amended with calcium silicate slag before planting, and the field should be well irrigated to avoid water stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preventive Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10g/kg of seed followed by seedling dip @ of 2.5 kg or products/ha dissolved in 100 litres and dipping for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Seed soak / seed treatment with Captan or Thiram at 2.0g/kg of seed.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment with Agrosan or Ceresan 2.5 g/kg seed to ward off seedling blight stage.</li>
            <li>Hot water seed treatment (53-54°C) for 10-12 minutes before sowing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chemical Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spray Mancozeb (2.0g/lit) or Edifenphos (1ml/lit) - 2 to 3 times at 10 - 15 day intervals.</li>
            <li>Spray preferably during early hours or afternoon at flowering and post-flowering stages.</li>
            <li>Spray Copper fungicides to control secondary spread.</li>
            <li>Use fungicides for seed treatment such as Captan, Thiram, Chitosan, Carbendazim, or Mancozeb.</li>
            <li>Application of edifenphos, chitosan, iprodione, or carbendazim in the field is also advisable.</li>
        </ul>
