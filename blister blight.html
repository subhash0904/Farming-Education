    <h1>Blister Blight: Exobasidium vexans</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Small, pinhole-size spots are initially seen on young leaves less than a month old.</p>
    <p>As the leaves develop, the spots become transparent, larger, and light brown.</p>
    <p>After about 7 days, the lower leaf surface develops blister-like symptoms, with dark green, water-soaked zones surrounding the blisters.</p>
    <p>Following release of the fungal spores, the blister becomes white and velvety.</p>
    <p>Subsequently the blister turns brown, and young infected stems become bent and distorted and may break off or die.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle:</h2>
    <p>The disease cycle repeats continuously during favorable (wet) conditions, and the spores are readily dispersed by wind.</p>
    <p>Spores that land on a leaf with adequate moisture will germinate and infect it, producing visible symptoms within 10 days.</p>
    <p>The fungus can directly penetrate the leaf tissue.</p>
    <p>The basidiospores have a low survival rate under conditions of drought or bright sunlight.</p>
    <p>The life cycle of the fungus is 3â€“4 weeks.</p>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Removal of affected leaves and shoots by pruning and destruction of the same have been recommended.</li>
        <li>Spraying of Bordeaux mixture or Copper Oxy Chloride 0.1%.</li>
        <li>A mixture of 210g of Copper oxy Chloride + 210g of nickel chloride per ha sprayed at 5 days interval from June to September and October to November.</li>
        <li>Spray Tridemorph at 340 and 560 ml/ha is satisfactory under mild and moderate rainfall conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Implementing these management practices is crucial for controlling and mitigating the impact of Blister Blight on tea plants. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
