        <h1>How Does Brown Rust Affect Wheat Yields?</h1>
        <p>Severe brown rust infections take out significant green leaf area and reduce the rate of photosynthesis needed for grain fill, and increase the rate of transpiration to cause drought susceptibility. Grain shrivel and specific weight reductions reduce both yield and quality.</p>
        <p>Average yield reductions from difficult infections are around 15%, but severe infections can reduce yield by up to 40%.</p>
        <p>The % yield loss from brown rust infections can be roughly calculated using the formula 0.4 x % flag infection at GS75.</p>

        <h2>How to Recognize Symptoms of Brown Rust</h2>
        <p>Seedling infections are much more easily confused with yellow rust than on more mature leaves. Brown rust has randomly scattered discrete orange-brown pustules that are more rounded and compact. Yellow rust pustules are formed in stripes, and are a more yellow-orange hue. Individual pustules are themselves elongated.</p>

        <h2>How to Control Brown Rust</h2>
        <p>Effective brown rust control comes from a programmed approach to minimize any early season inoculum and from protectant sprays, since the disease is very difficult to eradicate once established in the crop...</p>
        
        <p>Our recommendation is to use 1L/ha of Aviator or 1.2-1.5L/ha of AscraXpro...</p>
