    <h1>Twig Dieback and Stem Canker: Macrophoma theicola</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>The first symptoms include browning and drooping of affected leaves.</p>
    <p>As the disease spreads into the shoots, they become dry and die.</p>
    <p>The entire branch can die from the tip downward.</p>
    <p>Dying branches often have cankersâ€”shallow, slowly spreading lesions surrounded by a thick area of bark.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle:</h2>
    <p>The fungus produces spores on small, pear-shaped pycnidia on dead branches.</p>
    <p>Spores are spread when splashed by rain and can survive for several weeks on pruned branches left in the field.</p>
    <p>The fungus usually requires wounded plant tissue to gain entry and initiate infection.</p>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant in well-draining, acidic soils.</li>
        <li>Remove diseased twigs by cutting several inches below cankered areas and disinfecting them.</li>
        <li>Spray appropriate protective fungicides during periods of wet weather or natural leaf drop to protect leaf scars from infection.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Effective management practices involve soil conditions, proper pruning, and timely application of fungicides to protect tea plants from Twig Dieback and Stem Canker caused by Macrophoma theicola.</blockquote>
