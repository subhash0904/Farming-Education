    <h1>Managing Root Rot in Cotton Crops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Germinating seedling shows black lesions on hypocotyls, girdling of stem, and death of seedlings.</li>
        <li>Affected basal stem becomes dark with bark shredding, and sclerotial bodies present in the shredded bark.</li>
        <li>The entire root system gets rotted, plants dried, and the affected plants can be easily pulled out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival and Mode of Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The disease is soil-borne, and the pathogen can survive in the soil as sclerotia for several years.</li>
        <li>Primary spread is through soil-borne sclerotia.</li>
        <li>Secondary spread through sclerotia disseminated by irrigation water, implements, heavy winds, and other cultural operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry weather following heavy rains.</li>
        <li>High soil temperature (35-39Â°C), low soil moisture (15-20 per cent).</li>
        <li>Cultivation of favorable hosts like vegetables, oil seeds, and legumes preceding cotton and wounds caused by ash-weevil grubs and nematodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and burn the infected plant debris in the soil after deep summer plowing.</li>
        <li>Apply farmyard manure @4 t/ac or neem cake @ 60 kg/ac.</li>
        <li>Take up sowing in the first week of April or last week of June.</li>
        <li>Adopt intercropping with sorghum or moth bean (Phaseolus aconitifolius) to lower the soil temperature.</li>
        <li>Treat the acid-delinted seeds with Chlorothalonil at 4 g/kg of seed.</li>
        <li>Treat seeds with Bacillus subtilis (10g/kg) or Trichoderma asperellum at 4 g/kg.</li>
        <li>Treat seeds with Tetraconazole 11.6% w/w (12.5% w/v) SL @2 g /kg of seed Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS @2.5g/ kg of seed.</li>
        <li>Apply Trichoderma asperellum at 1 kg/acre, twice in the soil during sowing and 90 DAS. Multiply 1 kg of T. asperellum in 100 kg of farmyard manure for 15 days before application.</li>
        <li>Spot drench with Carbendazim @ 1 g/l or Trifloxystrobin + Tebuconazole @ 0.75g/l at the base of affected plants and surrounding healthy plants.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Root Rot in your cotton crops. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive cotton fields.</blockquote>
