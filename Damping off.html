    <h1>Managing Damping Off of Tobacco: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Damping off of tobacco occurs in two stages, i.e., the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the pre-emergence phase, the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.</li>
        <li>The young radical and the plumule are killed, and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.</li>
        <li>The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of the collar at the ground level.</li>
        <li>The infected tissues become soft and water-soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival and Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The fungus survives in the soil.</li>
        <li>Primary infection occurs by soil, and secondary infection occurs through conidia through rain or wind.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <p>High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness, and low temperatures below 24Â°C for a few days are ideal for infection and development of the disease.</p>
    <p>Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage, and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.</p>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Damping Off of Tobacco. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tobacco crop.</blockquote>
