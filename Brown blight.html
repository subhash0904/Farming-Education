    <h1>Brown Blight, Grey Blight: Colletotrichum sp., Pestalotiopsis sp.</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Small, oval, pale yellow-green spots first appear on young leaves.</p>
    <p>Often the spots are surrounded by a narrow, yellow zone.</p>
    <p>As the spots grow and turn brown or gray, concentric rings with scattered, tiny black dots become visible, and eventually, the dried tissue falls, leading to defoliation.</p>
    <p>Leaves of any age can be affected.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The tiny, black spots on the lesions contain the fungal spores.</li>
        <li>Rain splash transports the spores from one plant or site of infection to another.</li>
        <li>If the spores land on a leaf, they germinate to start a new leaf spot or a latent infection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid plant stress.</li>
        <li>Grow tea bushes with adequate spacing to permit air to circulate and reduce humidity and the duration of leaf wetness.</li>
        <li>Spray Copper Oxy Chloride or Bordeaux mixture 0.1% during the winter season and Summer season.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these management practices, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Brown Blight and Grey Blight on tea plants. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
