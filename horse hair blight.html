    <h1>Horse Hair Blight: Marasmius crinisequi</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Black fungal threads resembling horse hair are attached to upper branches and twigs by small brown discs.</p>
    <p>The fungus penetrates and infects the twigs from the discs and produces volatile substances that cause rapid leaf drop.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle:</h2>
    <p>This pathogen is spread from infected twigs to healthy twigs by extending its hair-like threads.</p>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and destroy all crop debris from around plants.</li>
        <li>Prune out infected or dead branches from the plant canopy.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Effective management practices involve regular removal of crop debris and pruning of infected branches, which are essential for controlling and mitigating the impact of Horse Hair Blight on tea plants. Timely intervention is crucial for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
