    <h1>Disease Symptoms of Brown Spot</h1>

    <h2>Brown Spot Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Initially, it appears on lower and older leaves as small brown, concentric circular lesions, which spread to upper leaves, petioles, stalks, and capsules.</p>
    <p>In warm weather under high humidity, the leaf spots enlarge, 1-3 cm in diameter, centers are necroses and turn brown with characteristic markings, giving a target board appearance with a definite outline.</p>
    <p>In severe infection, spots enlarge, coalesce, and damage large areas, making the leaf dark-brown, ragged, and worthless.</p>

    <h2>Survival and Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The pathogen survives through spores (conidia) or mycelium in diseased plant debris or weed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <p>Warm weather with high humidity.</p>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Brown Spot. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
