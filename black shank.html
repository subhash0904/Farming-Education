    <h1>Disease Symptoms and Management Guide</h1>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>The disease is characterized by scattered, rapidly enlarging, irregular, brown, water-soaked lesions with characteristic gray-green borders.</p>
    <p>Symptom development occurs particularly during and immediately following periods of heavy rains and high relative humidity.</p>

    <h2>Survival and Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary infection occurs by inoculum present in plant debris in soil.</li>
        <li>Secondary infection occurs by means of sporangia through air and water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <p>High soil moisture and moist weather conditions with intermittent showers are responsible for the development of the disease.</p>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of the disease. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining a healthy and productive crop.</blockquote>
