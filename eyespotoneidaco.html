        <h1>Eyespot Disease</h1>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            The first visible symptoms of eyespot are small, circular spots (1/16 inch to 1/8 inch diameter) that are
            water-soaked with yellow halos on leaves. These can occur as early as the V3/4 stage of vegetative growth.
            These lesions develop into an "eyespot", which is a tan spot surrounded by a brown to purple ring and narrow
            yellow halo. The spots can be scattered on leaves, but often appear in patches and can join together to form
            large necrotic areas. Lesions can sometimes develop on leaf sheaths and husks. The spots may sometimes be
            confused with a physiological or a genetic leaf spot.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Conditions and Timing that Favor Disease</h2>
        <p>
            The pathogen favors cool temperatures, humid and wet conditions, continuous corn, conservation tillage, and
            susceptible corn hybrids/inbreds.
        </p>

        <h2>Causal Pathogen</h2>
        <p>
            The pathogen is a fungus called <i>Aureobasidium zeae (Kabatiella zeae)</i>. It overwinters in the residue from
            corn, which is its only reported host.
        </p>

        <h2>Disease Management</h2>
        <p>
            Management strategies include using resistant corn hybrids, crop rotation, and tillage to reduce corn
            residue.
