    <h1>Managing Verticillium Wilt in Cotton Crops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Affects the crop in square and boll formation stages.</li>
        <li>Bronzing of veins followed by interveinal chlorosis, yellowing, and scorching of leaves.</li>
        <li>Leaves exhibit drying of leaf margins, and areas between veins show "Tiger stripe symptom."</li>
        <li>Affected plants remain barren showing pinkish discoloration in stem and wood.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival and Mode of Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Survive in infected plant debris and in soils as microsclerotia up to 14 years.</li>
        <li>Seeds also carry microsclerotia and conidia in the fuzz.</li>
        <li>Primary spread through soil.</li>
        <li>Secondary spread through the contact of diseased roots to healthy ones and through the dissemination of infected plant parts through irrigation water and other implements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorable Conditions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Low temperature of 15-20°C, low-lying, and ill-drained soils.</li>
        <li>Heavy soils with an alkaline condition.</li>
        <li>Heavy doses of nitrogenous fertilizers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and burn the infected plant debris in the soil after deep summer plowing.</li>
        <li>Apply farmyard manure or other organic manures at 4 t/ac.</li>
        <li>Follow mixed cropping with non-host plants to lower the soil temperature below 20°C by providing shade.</li>
        <li>Follow crop rotation by growing paddy or lucerne or chrysanthemum for 2-3 years.</li>
        <li>Treat the acid-delinted seeds with Chlorothalonil at 4 g/kg of seed.</li>
        <li>Treat seeds with Bacillus subtilis (10g/kg) or Trichoderma asperellum at 4 g/kg.</li>
        <li>Apply Trichoderma asperellum at 1 kg/acre, twice in the soil during sowing and 90 DAS. Multiply 1 kg of T. asperellum in 100 kg of farmyard manure for 15 days before application.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Verticillium wilt in your cotton crops. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive cotton fields.</blockquote>
