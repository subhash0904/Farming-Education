        <h2>Powdery Mildew</h2>

        <p><strong>Disease symptoms:</strong></p>
        <p>Powdery mildew can easily be diagnosed by the white, powdery patches that form on the upper surface of leaves and stem. Greyish white powdery growth appears on the leaf, sheath, stem, and floral parts. Powdery growth later becomes black lesions and causes drying of leaves and other parts.</p>

        <p><strong>Survival and spread:</strong></p>
        <p>Fungus remains in high hills during summers in infected plant debris as dormant mycelium and asci. Primary spread is by the asciospores and secondary spread through airborne conidia.</p>

        <p><strong>Favourable conditions:</strong></p>
        <p>The disease infects plants during periods of high humidity (not necessarily rain) and cool to moderate temperatures (20-21Â°C).</p>
