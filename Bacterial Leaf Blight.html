        <h1>Bacterial Leaf Blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae) Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Seedling wilt or kresek observed 1-3 weeks after transplanting.</li>
            <li>Green water-soaked layer along the cut portion or leaf tip of leaves as an early symptom.</li>
            <li>Leaves wilt and roll up, becoming grayish green to yellow.</li>
            <li>Entire plant may wilt completely.</li>
            <li>Leaf blight characterized by water-soaked to yellowish stripes on leaf blades or starting at leaf tips with a wavy margin.</li>
            <li>Bacterial ooze appears like a milky or opaque dewdrop on young lesions early in the morning.</li>
            <li>Severely infected leaves tend to dry quickly, leading to a loss in grain yield up to 60%.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Seedling Wilt-Kresek</li>
            <li>Leaves with Wavy Yellow Marginal Necrosis</li>
            <li>Drying and Curling of Leaves Leaving Midrib Intact</li>
            <li>Affected Leaves with Wavy Yellow Marginal Necrosis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identification of Pathogen</h2>
        <p>
            The bacteria causing the disease are rods, 1.2 x 0.3-0.5 µm. They are single, occasionally in pairs but not in chains. They are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming,
            and devoid of capsules. Their colonies on nutrient agar are pale yellow, circular, and smooth with an entire margin. They are convex and viscid.
        </p>

        <h2>Factors Favoring Disease Development</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Presence of weeds.</li>
            <li>Presence of rice stubbles and ratoons of infected plants.</li>
            <li>Presence of bacteria in the rice paddy and irrigation canals.</li>
            <li>Warm temperature (25-30°C), high humidity, rain, and deep water.</li>
            <li>Severe winds causing wounds and over-fertilization are suitable factors for the development of the disease.</li>
            <li>Irrigation water and splashing or windblown rain can disseminate the bacterium from plant to plant.</li>
            <li>The use of trimming tools for transplanting and handling during transplanting can also trigger new infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management Strategies</h2>

        <h3>Preventive Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seed treatment with bleaching powder (100g/l) and zinc sulfate (2%) reduces bacterial blight.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment - seed soaking for 8 hours in Agrimycin (0.025%) and wettable ceresan (0.05%) followed by hot water treatment for 30 min at 52-54°C.</li>
            <li>Seed soaking for 8 hours in ceresan (0.1%) and treat with Streptocyclin (3g in 1 litre).</li>
            <li>Spray neem oil 3% or NSKE 5%.</li>
            <li>Spray fresh cowdung extract for the control of bacterial blight.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Soak the Seeds in Agrimycin for 8 hours</li>
            <li>Spray Fresh Cowdung Extract</li>
            <li>Spray Neem Oil</li>
            <li>Treat the Seeds with Bleaching Powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cultural Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grow tolerant varieties (IR 20, IR 72, PONMANI, TKM 6).</li>
            <li>Secure disease-free seed.</li>
            <li>Grow nurseries preferably in isolated upland conditions.</li>
            <li>Avoid clipping of seedlings during transplanting.</li>
            <li>Balanced fertilization, avoid excess N - application.</li>
            <li>Skip N - application at booting (if the disease is moderate).</li>
            <li>Drain the field (except at the flowering stage of the crop).</li>
            <li>Destruction of weeds and collateral hosts.</li>
            <li>Avoid the flow of water from affected fields.</li>
            <li>Maintain proper plant spacing.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Avoid Field to Field Irrigation</li>
            <li>Maintain Proper Spacing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chemical Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seed treatment with bleaching powder (100g/l) and zinc sulfate (2%) reduces bacterial blight.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment - seed soaking for 8 hours in Agrimycin (0.025%) and wettable ceresan (0.05%) followed by hot water treatment for 30 min at 52-54°C.</li>
            <li>Seed soaking for 8 hours in ceresan (0.1%) and treat with Streptocyclin (3g in 1 litre).</li>
            <li>Spray Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline combination 300 g + Copper oxychloride 1.25kg/ha. If necessary repeat 15 days later.</li>
            <li>Application of bleaching powder @ 5 kg/ha in the irrigation water is recommended in the kresek stage.</li>
            <li>Foliar spray with copper fungicides alternatively with Streptocyclin (250 ppm) to check secondary spread.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Foliar Spraying of Copper Fungicides</li>
            <li>Seed Treatment with Zinc Sulphate</li>
        </ul>
