    <h1>Disease Symptoms and Management Guide</h1>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Symptoms appear as small water-soaked spots with a sunken center on leaves.</p>
    <p>Spots become white with a brown margin.</p>
    <p>Lesions occur also on midribs, petioles, and lateral veins causing distortion and ragged appearance.</p>
    <p>Lesions on the stem weaken the stem.</p>

    <h2>Survival and Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary infection occurs by sowing infected seeds.</li>
        <li>Secondary infection occurs by wind.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <p>Rain and high humidity are favorable for the development of the disease.</p>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of the disease. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining a healthy and productive crop.</blockquote>
