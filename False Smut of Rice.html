        <h1>False Smut (Ustilaginoidea virens) Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual rice grain transformed into a mass of yellow fruiting bodies.</li>
            <li>Growth of velvety spores that enclose floral parts.</li>
            <li>Infected grain has greenish smut balls with a velvety appearance.</li>
            <li>As the fungi growth intensifies, the smut ball bursts and becomes orange then later yellowish-green or greenish-black in color.</li>
            <li>Infection usually occurs during the reproductive and ripening stages, infecting a few grains in the panicle and leaving the rest healthy.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>1-Discoloration of Grains</li>
            <li>2-Grains Transformed into a Mass of Yellow Fruiting Bodies</li>
            <li>3-Greenish Black Smut Balls with a Velvety Appearance</li>
            <li>4-Smut Balls Bursts and Becomes Black in Color</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identification of Pathogen</h2>
        <p>
            False smut spores, microscopic view of spores. Chlamydospore formed on the spore balls are born laterally on minute sterigmata on radial hyphae,
            and are spherical to elliptical, warty, olivaceous, 3-5 x 4-6 Âµm. Younger spores are smaller, paler, and almost smooth. Some of the green spore
            balls develop one to four sclerotia in the center. These sclerotia overwinter in the field and produce stalked stromata the following summer or autumn.
            In temperate regions, the fungus survives the winter by means of sclerotia as well as chlamydospores. It is believed that the primary infections are initiated
            mainly by the ascospores produced from the sclerotia. Chlamydospores play an important role in secondary infection, which is a major part of the disease cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Conditions that Favor Disease Development</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Presence of rain and high humidity.</li>
            <li>Presence of soils with high nitrogen content.</li>
            <li>Presence of wind for dissemination of the spores from plant to plant.</li>
            <li>Presence of overwintering fungus as sclerotia and chlamydospores.</li>
            <li>Flowering stage of the rice crop.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management Strategies</h2>

        <h3>Preventive Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of disease-free seeds that are selected from a healthy crop.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment with carbendazim 2.0g/kg of seeds.</li>
            <li>Control insect pests.</li>
            <li>Split application of nitrogen is recommended.</li>
            <li>Removal and proper disposal of infected plant debris.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Use Disease-Free Seeds</li>
            <li>Seed Treatment with Carbendazim</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cultural Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Destruction of straw and stubble from infected plants is recommended to reduce the disease.</li>
            <li>Use varieties that are found to be resistant or tolerant against the disease in India.</li>
            <li>Avoid field activities when the plants are wet.</li>
            <li>Early planted crops have fewer smut balls than the late planted crop.</li>
            <li>At the time of harvesting, diseased plants should be removed and destroyed so that sclerotia do not fall in the field. This will reduce primary inoculum for the next crop.</li>
            <li>Field bunds and irrigation channels should be kept clean to eliminate alternate hosts.</li>
            <li>Excess application of nitrogenous fertilizer should be avoided.</li>
            <li>Regular monitoring of disease incidence during rabi season is essential.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Destruction of Straw and Stubbles</li>
            <li>Keep Irrigation Channel Clean</li>
            <li>Keep the Bunds Clean</li>
            <li>Use LCC to Avoid Excess Application of Nitrogen</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chemical Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spraying of copper oxychloride at 2.5 g/litre or Propiconazole at 1.0 ml/litre at boot leaf and milky stages will be more useful to prevent the fungal infection.</li>
            <li>At tillering and preflowering stages, spray Hexaconazole @ 1ml/lit or Chlorothalonil 2g/lit.</li>
            <li>In areas where the disease may cause yield loss, applying captan, captafol, fentin hydroxide, and mancozeb can inhibit conidial germination.</li>
            <li>At tillering and preflowering stages, spraying of carbendazim fungicide and copper base fungicide can effectively control the disease.</li>
        </ul>
