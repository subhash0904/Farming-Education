    <h1>Managing Fusarium Wilt in Cotton Crops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellowing and browning of cotyledons followed by browning on the petiole.</li>
        <li>Loss of turgidity, yellowing, drooping, and wilting of leaves.</li>
        <li>Browning or blackening of vascular tissues.</li>
        <li>Infected plants appear stunted with fewer bolls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival and Mode of Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Survive in soil as a saprophyte for many years, and chlamydospores act as resting spores.</li>
        <li>Primary spread is through seed, dormant hyphae, and chlamydospores.</li>
        <li>The pathogen is externally and internally seed-borne.</li>
        <li>Secondary spread by wind and irrigation water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorable Conditions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil temperature of 20-30°C.</li>
        <li>Hot and dry periods followed by rains.</li>
        <li>Heavy black soils with an alkaline reaction.</li>
        <li>Increased dose of nitrogen and phosphatic fertilizers.</li>
        <li>Wounds caused by nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) and grubs of Ash weevil (Myllocerus pustulatus).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and burn the infected plant debris in the soil after deep summer plowing.</li>
        <li>Apply farmyard manure or other organic manures at 4 t/ac.</li>
        <li>Follow mixed cropping with non-host plants to reduce soil temperature below 20°C by providing shade.</li>
        <li>Treat acid-delinted seeds with Chlorothalonil at 4 g/kg of seed.</li>
        <li>Seed treatment with Bacillus subtilis (10g/kg) or Trichoderma asperellum at 4 g/kg.</li>
        <li>Apply Trichoderma asperellum at 1 kg/acre, twice in the soil during sowing and 90 DAS. Multiply 1 kg of T. asperellum in 100 kg of farmyard manure for 15 days before application.</li>
        <li>Spot drenching with Carbendazim 50%WP at 1g/lit of water.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Fusarium wilt in your cotton crops. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive cotton fields.</blockquote>
