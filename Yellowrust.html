        <h1>Yellow Rust in Wheat</h1>
        <p>Other cereal rust fungi have macrocyclic, heteroecious life cycles, involving five spore stages and two phylogenetically unrelated hosts. P. striiformis was thought to be microcyclic for centuries until 2009, when a team of scientists at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Lab led by Yue Jin confirmed that barberry (Berberis and Mahonia spp.) is an alternate host. Barberry was known as an alternate host of the closely related stem rust (Puccinia graminis) and for many years...</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Stripe rust on wheat Yellow rust, or stripe rust, takes its name from the appearance of yellow-colored stripes produced parallel along the venations of each leaf blade. These yellow stripes are actually characteristic of uredinia that produce yellow-colored urediniospores. Primary hosts of yellow rust of wheat are Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), Triticum turgidum (durum wheat), triticale, and a few Hordeum vulgare (barley) cultivars...</p>

        <h2>Disease Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Breeding of resistant varieties is the most cost-effective method to control this rust.</li>
            <li>Fungicides are available but vary in availability depending on their registration restrictions by national or state governments.</li>
            <li>Development of varieties resistant to the disease is always an important objective in wheat breeding programs for crop improvement...</li>
