    <h1>Managing Alternaria Leaf Blight in Cotton Crops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The fungus infects the seedlings and produces small reddish circular spots on the cotyledons and primary leaves.</li>
        <li>The lesions develop on the collar region, stem may be girdled, causing seedling to wilt and die.</li>
        <li>In mature plants, the fungus attacks the stem, leading to stem splitting and shredding of bark.</li>
        <li>The most common symptom is boll spotting with small water soaked, circular, reddish brown depressed spots on the bolls.</li>
        <li>The lint is stained to yellow or brown, becomes a solid brittle mass of fiber.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survival and Mode of Spread:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The pathogen survives as dormant mycelium in the seed or as conidia on the surface of the seed.</li>
        <li>It also perpetuates on the rotten bolls and other plant debris in the soil.</li>
        <li>Primary spread is through infested seed and soil.</li>
        <li>Secondary spread is through air-borne conidia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favourable Conditions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prolonged rainfall at the time of boll formation and close planting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and burn the infected plant debris and bolls in the soil.</li>
        <li>Rogue out the reservoir weed hosts.</li>
        <li>Treat the acid-delinted seeds with Chlorothalonil at 4 g/kg of seed.</li>
        <li>Spray Copper oxychloride @ 500 g/acre, at the boll formation stage.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Alternaria Leaf Blight in your cotton crops. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive cotton fields.</blockquote>
