        <h1>Foot rot/Bakane Disease Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Infected plants several inches taller than normal plants in seedbed and field.</li>
            <li>Thin plants with yellowish-green leaves and pale green flag leaves.</li>
            <li>Drying seedlings at early tillering.</li>
            <li>Reduced tillering and drying leaves at late infection.</li>
            <li>Partially filled grains, sterile, or empty grains for surviving plants at maturity.</li>
            <li>In the seedbed, infected seedlings with lesions on roots die, which may occur before or after transplanting.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Identification of Pathogen</li>
            <li>Gibberella fujikorai Conidium</li>
            <li>Micro and Macro Conidia of Bakane Disease</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The pathogen sexually produces ascospores that are formed within a sac known as ascus. The asci are cylindrical, piston-shaped, flattened above, and are 90-102 x 7-9 µm.
            They are 4- to 6-spored but seldom 8-spored. Hyphae are branched and septate. The fungus has micro- and macroconidiophores bearing micro- and macroconidia, respectively.
            The sclerotia are 80 x 100 µm. They are dark blue and spherical. The stroma is more or less plectenchymatous and yellowish, brownish, or violet.
        </p>

        <h2>Management Strategies</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean seeds should be used to minimize the occurrence of the disease.</li>
            <li>Saltwater can be used to separate lightweight, infected seeds from seed lots and thereby reduce seedborne inoculum.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment using fungicides such as thiram, thiophanate-methyl, or benomyl is effective before planting.</li>
            <li>Benomyl or benomyl-t at 1-2% of seed weight should be used for dry seed coating.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment with organo mercurials - Agrosan GN, Ceresan @ 2 g a.i./kg seed is highly effective; steeping seeds in 1% CuSO4 solution or 2% formalin also recommended.</li>
        </ul>
