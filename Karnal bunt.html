Disease symptoms
Symptoms of Karnal bunt are often difficult to distinguish in the field due to the fact that incidence of infected kernels on a given head is low.
There may be some spreading of the glumes due to sorus production but it is not as extensive as that observed with common bunt.
Symptoms are most readily detected on seed after harvest.


Survival and spread
The disease is seeds borne and sowing of infected seeds is the source of primary infection.
Fabourable conditions
Temperature of 18-20Â°C.
High soil moisture.
