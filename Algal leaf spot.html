    <h1>Algal Leaf Spot: Cephaleuros virescens</h1>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Leaves develop lesions that are roughly circular, raised, and purple to reddish-brown.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The alga produces microscopic, rust-colored, spore-like bodies on the surface of the leaf spots, giving them a reddish tinge.</li>
        <li>The “spores” are dispersed by wind or rain.</li>
        <li>The alga may spread from leaves to branches and fruit.</li>
        <li>Poor soil drainage, imbalanced nutrition, and exposure to relatively high temperature and humidity predispose tea plants to infection by algal leaf spot, so it is important to strengthen the plant through proper cultivation and fertilization.</li>
        <li>Most algal spots develop on the upper leaf surface.</li>
        <li>Older infections become greenish-gray and look like lichen. Cephaleuros usually does not harm the plant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid plant stress.</li>
        <li>Avoid poorly drained sites.</li>
        <li>Promote good air circulation in the plant canopy to reduce humidity and duration of leaf wetness.</li>
        <li>Removal of infected portions by spraying of bordeaux mixture.</li>
        <li>Destruction of affected plant portions.</li>
        <li>Improving the nutrient status of the soil by application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>By following these management practices, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Algal Leaf Spot on tea plants. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive plants.</blockquote>
