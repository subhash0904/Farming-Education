        <h1>Sheath Blight Management</h1>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The fungus affects the crop from tillering to heading stage.</li>
            <li>Initial symptoms are noticed on leaf sheaths near water level.</li>
            <li>Oval, elliptical, or irregular greenish-grey spots form on the leaf sheath.</li>
            <li>As the spots enlarge, the center becomes greyish-white with an irregular blackish-brown or purple-brown border.</li>
            <li>Lesions on the upper parts of plants extend rapidly, coalescing with each other to cover entire tillers from the water line to the flag leaf.</li>
            <li>Several large lesions on a leaf sheath usually cause death of the whole leaf; in severe cases, all leaves of a plant may be blighted.</li>
            <li>The infection extends to the inner sheaths, resulting in death of the entire plant.</li>
            <li>Older plants and five to six-week-old leaf sheaths are highly susceptible.</li>
            <li>Plants heavily infected in the early heading and grain-filling growth stages produce poorly filled grain.</li>
            <li>A yield loss of 25% was reported if the flag leaves are infected.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>1- Elliptical or irregular greenish-grey spots on sheaths</li>
            <li>2- Blightening of sheath near water level</li>
            <li>3- Blightening of sheath</li>
            <li>4- Discoloration of sheath</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identification of Pathogen</h2>
        <p>
            Old culture of Rhizoctonia solani: The disease is soilborne. The fungus produces usually long cells of septate mycelium which are hyaline when young,
            yellowish-brown when old. It produces a large number of globoses sclerotia, which are initially white, later turn brown or purplish brown.
        </p>

        <h2>Favourable Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Presence of sclerotia or infection bodies floating on the water.</li>
            <li>Presence of the disease in the soil.</li>
            <li>Relative humidity from 96 to 100%.</li>
            <li>Temperature from 28-32 Â°C.</li>
            <li>High levels of nitrogen fertilizer.</li>
            <li>High seeding rate or closing plant spacing.</li>
            <li>Frequent rain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mode of Spread and Survival</h2>
        <p>
            The pathogen can survive as sclerotia or mycelium in dry soil for about 20 months but for 5-8 months in moist soil.
            Sclerotia spread through irrigation water.
        </p>

        <h2>Management Strategies</h2>

        <h3>Preventive Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10g/kg of seed followed by seedling dip @ of 2.5 kg or products/ha dissolved in 100 litres and dipping for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Soil application of P.fluorescens @ of 2.5 kg/ha after 30 days of transplanting (This product should be mixed with 50 kg of FYM/Sand and then applied).</li>
            <li>Foliar spray of Pseudomonas fluorescens at 0.2% concentration, commencing from 45 days after transplanting at 10 days interval for 3 times depending upon the intensity of disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cultural Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply FYM 12.5 t/ha or green manure 6.25 t/ha to promote antagonistic microflora.</li>
            <li>Avoid excess doses of fertilizers.</li>
            <li>Adopt optimum spacing.</li>
            <li>Eliminate weed hosts.</li>
            <li>Apply organic amendments.</li>
            <li>Avoid the flow of irrigation water from infected fields to healthy fields.</li>
            <li>Deep ploughing in summer and burning of stubbles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chemical Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Control of sheath blight has been mainly through the use of foliar fungicides.</li>
            <li>Carbendazim (1 g/lit), Propiconazole (1ml/lit) may be applied.</li>
            <li>Spraying of infected plants with fungicides, such as Benomyl and Iprodione, and antibiotics, such as Validamycin and Polyoxin, is effective against the disease.</li>
            <li>Spray Carbendazim 250 g or Chlorothalonil 1 kg or Edifenphos 1 lit/ha.</li>
        </ul>
