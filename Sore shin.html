    <h1>Disease Symptoms of Rhizoctonia solani on Tobacco Seedlings</h1>

    <h2>Target Spot:</h2>
    <p>Symptoms on leaves begin as small, round, water-soaked spots about 2-3 mm in diameter.</p>
    <p>Under favorable conditions, these lesions enlarge rapidly, becoming light green, almost transparent, with irregular margins and chlorotic halos.</p>
    <p>In infested areas, lower leaves turn brown and stick to the surface of the tray, and the presence of brown spider-like webs (mycelium) may be observed attached to leaves and stems.</p>

    <h2>Damping-off:</h2>
    <p>This disease is usually observed at early stages of seedling growth.</p>
    <p>The first symptom is a small water-soaked lesion on the stem close to the soil line that rapidly becomes brown and sunken.</p>
    <p>Under favorable conditions, lesions become very constricted, and the stems break off. The lesions continue to grow throughout the stem and leaves causing them to turn brown and die.</p>

    <blockquote>By implementing these comprehensive management strategies, you can effectively control and mitigate the impact of Rhizoctonia solani on tobacco seedlings. Regular monitoring, early detection, and timely intervention are essential for maintaining healthy and productive seedlings in greenhouses.</blockquote>
